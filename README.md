# Image-Classification
Mini-project for internship where I designed a model that can distinguish between 3 types of image
for creating this I have used GridSearchCv and svm classification model, I have use bing-image-dowloader to download the images whuch i have used to create the model
I have used mkdir to create a image folder which later I have uploaded in my drive.
To run this project , run the collab notebook and edit the path of the folder as per your need
